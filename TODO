[NICE-TO-HAVE] get birthdays from pidgin
    tomspur: Why? There is a pidgin and evolution integration.
        Then you'll have your pidin contacts in evolution and can get it
        from there.

[OTHER_UPSTREAM_WORK] improve python2-evolution to emit contact.props.birth_date and use that instead of the vcard


DONE:
[XXX] set AdressBook for each database in constructor (?)
[BUGFIX] close about-dialog with X
